# Work in Progress

# About

This is a project attempting to make a USB keyboard/Trackpoint controller and enclosure for the non-chiclet Thinkpad keyboard (from the 10/20 generation, such as the T410, W520, etc.). These were, in my opinion, the best Thinkpad keyboards ever made.

# Controller

The current plan is to use an RP2040 microcontroller running QMK to handle the key matrix scanning and Trackpoint. I would also like to add a USB 2.0 hub.


# Future goals

I would like to eventually adapt this keyboard to be used on the Framework 13 laptop, which would require designing a custom lower chassis for the Framework laptop. That is well in the future, but the engineering required for this project lays much of the groundwork for that project.
